# Deep-Learning-Challenge
Use deep learning to help venture capitalist and non-profits select the best candidates for funding. Achieve model optimazation through multiple runs of the model, adjusting hidden and node layers, and epochs. 

## Path to Code:

 -JoeyForgetabbait/Deep-Learning-Challenge/alphabetsoup_op1.ipynb
 -JoeyForgetabbait/Deep-Learning-Challenge/alphabetsoup_op2.ipynb

## Results...
- Our initial training model had an accuracy of 72%, after adjustments, a second optimaztion bumped the model slighly to 75%. Finally, an ajdustment in the zero direction (and a shit ton of cpu lag) brought our model to 97% accuracy.
